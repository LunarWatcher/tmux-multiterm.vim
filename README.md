# tmux-multiterm.vim

This plugin aims to establish interop with tmux, with a high focus on multiple screens by requiring tmux to be run externally. This also makes sure it's possible to use both Vim and gVim, and theoretically other forks (TUI and GUI). Additionally, this plugin aims to allow you to set up custom runner commands that pipe into any window or buffer you want.

The main idea is to allow you to set up commands that run in different buffers, or even different sessions with minimal hacking and minimal typing. Set up your favorite tmux grid, set up mappings in vim, and interact with tmux from vim.
